This request is asking for community observation support beginning 2022-04-26 through 2022-04-27.</p>       <p>The justification given in this request is: "It is important to get single BVRI sequences each night, but longer sets of data would be useful if they can be obtained simultaneously with the HST observations. There will not be any TESS observations", so your coverage is especially important. Note that it is extremely important to have a positive V observation 24 hours before the scheduled HST time..</p>       <p>The submitters instructions are: Finder charts with comparison stars for the targets may be created using the AAVSO Variable Star Plotter (VSP). Sequences are being added; if they are not available at the time of your observation(s), please save your images and reduce them as soon as the sequences are available.</p>       <p>The submitters notes to observers follow: </p>       <p>The submitters have included the following table:</p>       <img src= 'static/s.jpg' /><p>Cadences selected are: nightly </p>       <p>Variability types indicated are: cataclymic variables </p>       <p>Modes of Observing selected are:</p>       <p>Photometry filters that may be used include:       <p></p>Target stars are (* indicates not found in VSX):<p><table width=40%;border:none;>
